# Literature search

The detailed information on the literature search is already presented in the main body of the manuscript However, a brief overview is presented here.

Our aim was to conduct a comprehensive search for studies evaluating the ecological impacts of *Lantana camara* invasion by comparing invaded and uninvades sites.  For this, we first performed a systematic search for published literature using the Web of Science (WoS) core collection database on 10 October, 2021  (Timespan: all years). We screened the retrieved literature for duplicates and irrelevant titles and abstracts using the revtools package **[(Westgate, 2019)](https://doi.org/10.1002/jrsm.1374)**. Second, using the included articles from WoS as seed, we searched backward references and forward citations of these selected articles on 18 October, 2021, with the help of citationchaser package **[(Haddaway et al., 2022)](https://doi.org/10.1002/jrsm.1563)** to identify additional articles that might have been missed in the main database search. The details of the key word combination and the Boolean operators included in search string for WoS is shown below, along with a flow diagram (often referred to as a PRISMA flow chart: Figure 1) which shows the numbers of articles retrieved during the literature search and those included as well as excluded at each stage of screening process.
All screening was performed by the lead author **RA**.

 **Web of Science Core Collection:**
  
TS=(("*Lantana camara*" OR "Spanish flag" OR "red-sage" OR "red sage") AND ("inva\*") AND ("impact\*" OR "effect\*" OR "modif\*" OR "change\*" OR "influence\*") AND ("richness" OR "diversity" OR "community structure\*" OR "community assemblage\*" OR "ecosystem structure" OR "ecosystem function\*" OR "population\*" OR "composition\*" OR "ecosystem process\*" OR "ecosystem pool\*" OR "ecosystem flux\*" OR "competition\*" OR "evenness" OR "biodiversity" OR "biological diversity" OR "abundance\*" OR "biomass" OR "producti\*" OR "growth" OR "cover" OR "densit\*" OR "species abundance distribution\*" OR "biogeochemical" OR "nutrient cycl\*" OR "cycling of nutrient\*" OR "nutrient dynamics" OR "nutrient flux\*" OR "nutrient pool\*" OR "flux\* of nutrient\*" OR "carbon" OR "nitrogen" OR "phosphorous" OR "pH" OR "organic matter" OR "decomposition" OR "litter" OR "soil" OR "hydrolog\*" OR "water" OR "resource\*"))
  
We followed reporting guidelines outlined in the PRISMA-EcoEvo checklist **[(O'Dea et al., 2021)](https://doi.org/10.1111/brv.12721)**.

### Levels of Ecological organization and response classes
We classified each of the ecological variable into three levels of ecological organization based on whether impacts are related to species, resident communities, or ecosystem properties and functioning. Also, we categorized the studied variables into 25 response classes (i.e., impact types) modified after **[Vila et al. (2011)](https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1461-0248.2011.01628.x)** and **[Cameron et al. (2016)](https://doi.org/10.1111/geb.12436)** (see Table S1 below). 

**Table S1**: Categorization of the studied variables into 25 response classes (impact types) and three levels of ecological organization.

## Choosing the appropriate effect size statistics: checking the mean-variance relationship
In order to choose the appropriate effect size statistic, We checked the `mean-variance relationship` in our data. Relevant to mention that the data has not been filtered to the extent that we have used in the below shown meta-analyses, but is simply used here to demonstrate whether any mean-variance relationships exist. If there is an indication of such a relationship, it is better to use the `logarithm of response ratio (i.e., lnRR)` to study the mean effect rather than the standardized mean difference (i.e., Cohen's d or Hedges' g) because the latter assumes the homogeneity of variance and the `log coefficient of variation ratio (i.e., lnCVR)` to evaluate the variability effect.

```{r fig.width=10, width = "100%"}
# First, clean up the data
data_t<-full_data %>% filter(sdT != 0)
data_c<-full_data %>% filter(sdC != 0)

cor_t <- round(with(data_t,cor(log(mT), log(sdT))), 3)
cor_c <- round(with(data_c,cor(log(mC), log(sdC))), 3)

plot_t <- ggplot(data_t, aes(log(mT), log(sdT))) +
  geom_point(color = "#66C2A5", size = 1.5) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, color="black") + 
  labs(x = "ln(mean[invaded])", 
       y = "ln(SD[invaded])") + 
  annotate('text',x = 7.5, y = -8, label = paste("r = ", cor_t)) +
  theme_classic()

plot_c <- ggplot(data_c, aes(log(mC), log(sdC))) +
  geom_point(color = "#FC8D62", size = 1.5) +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE, color="black") + 
  labs(x = "ln(mean[Control])", 
       y = "ln(SD[Control])") + 
  annotate('text',x = 7.5, y = -8, label = paste("r = ", cor_c)) +
  theme_classic()
ggarrange(plot_t, plot_c, ncol = 2, nrow = 1, labels = c("a", "b"))

```

# Meta-analyses
## Calculating effect sizes
Since we found stronger mean variance relationship on the log scale above, so instead, we used the `log of the coefficient of variation ratio (lnCVR)` to report variability and the `log response ratio (lnRR)` to compare mean effects.

We calculated the effect sizes using `escalc` function in `metafor` package **[(Viechtbauer, 2010)](https://doi.org/10.18637/jss.v036.i03)**. Here we used the treatment (invaded) as the numerator and control (uninvaded) as denominator. We also make use of the `make_VCV_matrix` function from the `metaAidR` package to calculate the variance-covariance matrix assuming a correlation of 0.5 for use in the model instead of the error term `vi` to overcome the dependence of sampling errors resulting from multiple outcomes **[(Noble et al., 2017)](https://doi.org/10.1111/mec.14031)**. The reason for this is that when more than one effect size is reported from the same experimental unit (cohort) (i.e., different biodiversity metrics measured in the same quadrat or different nutrients estimated from the same soil sample), the sampling error of these effect sizes will be correlated. Also, in cases where more than one treatment groups are compared to the same control group, the sampling error of the effect sizes is considered to be correlated. To overcome the dependence of sampling errors arising from shared control problem, we calculated  a modified sample size (n) for shared control groups by dividing the original sample size of the control group by the number of shared controls and used the modified sample size for effect size calculation **[(Higgins et al., 2019)](https://training.cochrane.org/handbook/archive/v6)**.

# Meta-analytic models: lnRR and lnCVR
We conducted multilevel meta-analytic models (i.e. intercept only models) using the `rma.mv` function from the `metafor` package **[(Viechtbauer, 2010)](https://doi.org/10.18637/jss.v036.i03)**. The `rma.mv`function allows us to incorporate variance-covariance matrices in the `V` term. We fitted two random effects i.e. `effect size ID` (ES_ID)  to measure the residual heterogeneity and `study ID` (PR_ID) to account for non-independence of multiple effect sizes originating within the same study.

```{r}

# for mean effect

**Figure 2 (main manuscript).** Meta-analytic model comparing the mean (lnRR) (a) and variability (lnCVR) (b) of ecological variables in *Lantana camara* invaded sites with control (uninvaded) sites. Shown are the model estimated means (central points), along with thick 95% confidence intervals (thick bars - indicating uncertainty around the overall estimate), and 95% prediction intervals (thin bars - indicating the predicted range for 95% of new or simply not included effect sizes). Each of the background point represents an effect size, with its size proportional to the precision of its estimate (1/SE).

# Meta-regression models: lnRR and lnCVR
We carried a series of univariate meta-regression models for each of the following moderators to test our research questions: **(a)**`Response class (i.e., impact type)`, **(b)** `Level_ecological_organization`, **(c)** `Ecosysyem_type`, **(d)** `Continent`, **(e)** `Study_design` and **(f)** `Latitude`. Simply, these moderators help us to investigate whether the *Lantana camara* associated impacts varies with different variables, and also allow us to estimate the invasion effects associated with different levels of these factors.

# Publication bias

We used multiple proceedures as recommended **[Nakagawa et al., (2021)](https://doi.org/10.1111/2041-210X.13724)** to check the existances of publication bias in our data. First, we used the traditional `funnel plot` to visually evaluate the asymmetry. Second, we used a multilevel meta regression model with the `sampling standard error` (i.e., square-root of the sampling variances) as a moderator to assess whether there exists any evidence of small-study effects in our dataset (modified `Egger's regression`). Third, we assessed a `time-lag bias` (i.e., declining effect over time) by running a multilevel meta-regression model with `publication year` as a continuous moderator.

## Funnel plot

```{r, fig.width=11}

# univariate egger regressoin

egger_uni_rr <- rma.mv(yi = lnRR, V = lnRR.sv, mods = ~sqrt(lnRR.sv), test = "t", random = list(~1 | PR_ID, ~1 | ES_ID), method = "REML", data = data_es_rr)


egger_uni_cvr <- rma.mv(yi = lnCVR, V = lnCVR.sv, mods = ~sqrt(lnCVR.sv), test = "t", random = list(~1 | PR_ID, ~1 | ES_ID), method = "REML", data = data_es_cvr)

### plotting funnel plots

funnel(egger_uni_rr, yaxis = "seinv", xlim = c(-7, 7), level = c(90, 95, 99), shade = c("white", "gray55", "gray75"), refline = 0, legend = TRUE)
mtext("a", side = 3, line = 0, adj = -0.2, cex = 1.5)
funnel(egger_uni_cvr, yaxis = "seinv", xlim = c(-7, 7), level = c(90, 95, 99), shade = c("white", "gray55", "gray75"), refline = 0, legend = TRUE)
mtext("b", side = 3, line = 0, adj = -0.2, cex = 1.5)
```
**Figure S5.** Funnel plots testing for the asymmetry for (a) mean (lnRR) and (b) variability (lnCVR) effect of *Lantana camara* invasion relative to uninvaded conditions. 

## Univariate Egger's regression

Next, we fit a uni-moderator multilevel meta-regression including the effect sizes'standard error, `SE (sqrt(vi))` as a moderator. A significant slope for SE (sqrt(vi)) would indicate statistically significant funnel asymmetry **[(Bishop and Nakagawa, 2020)](https://doi.org/10.1111/1365-2664.13830)**.
